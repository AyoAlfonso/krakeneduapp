We tried setting up our own Jitsi server — appealing because it's open source and very flexible — but the quality left a lot to be desired, and we'd like to explore better video integrations.

It might be useful to split the Meta Course into two parts, one for initial ideation and syllabus generation, and the other for actually testing out an idea and getting hands-on facilitation practice.

Can we facilitate testing out courses with extreme time scales, or other radical structures?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What might encourage more asynchronous discussion on the forum (or elsewhere)? Perhaps we can build in some more explicit functionality for prompts or automated reminders.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`How can build a better-feeling cohort space for live group learning? How can we design for a communal feel to the calls and conversations?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Can we get participants' networks involved earlier?
