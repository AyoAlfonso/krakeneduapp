In fact the very institutional nature of schools, their all-encompassing overreach, is bound up with their failure to fulfill their purported mission.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We have an urgent need for something different.

This \"hidden curriculum\" falsely separates the context of learning from the real world, and alienates learners.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We need to replace \"manipulative\" institutions with \"convivial ones\" — community-developed systems, humble and human, designed for freedom, creativity, and individual empowerment. Such institutions can manifest as true public goods, like postal services useful to all citizens, rather than \"false utilities\" like highway systems that subsidize owners of private vehicles.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"learning-outside-of-school\"\n    }}>{`Learning Outside of School`}</h2>\n    <p>{`While we're conditioned to think of school as where learning happens, it also\nhappens just about everywhere else, too! \"Everyone learns how to live outside\nschool\" — learning from peers, chance encounters, participation with all kinds\nof other people, places, and things.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Illich describes the more explicit of these non-school learning systems collectively as \"educational webs\", democratized and decentralized networks through which effective learning can happen.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One idea for how this might manifest is a network of \"skill centers\", local places for hands-on learning which students could visit by way of an \"educational passport\", working with teachers for specific skills. Another possibility is an interest-based matching system, where people are paired based on common interest in (say) a book, article, or film, and convene to discuss it together.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is not a single system but a loose collection, knitted together across a wider civic community. In this vision, learning is less about an obligatory process of instruction, and more about facilitating journeys, matching learners with guides and co-conspirators.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"making-learning-personal\"\n    }}>{`Making Learning Personal`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Core to this vision is re-centering the individual in the learning process. Learning, as Illich maintains, \"can only be a personal activity\". It's meaningful to the extent it helps the individual build a self and a place in their community. It cannot be commoditized.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This doesn't mean learning by oneself. Peers, too, play an important role. Learning is social, and to facilitate \"creative, exploratory learning\", it's vital to get people together who are interested in the same things.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Top down instruction is antithetical to imagination and authentic personal growth. True learning doesn't need so much manipulation, so much measurement and documentation.
