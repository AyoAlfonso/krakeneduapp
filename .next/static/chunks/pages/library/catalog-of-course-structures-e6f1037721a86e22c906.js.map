Ideally you want to balance the workload such that it comes across as meaningful, but doesn't scare people off. It's usually a good idea to think about how your course might adapt to work for busy participants who don't have time for much beyond the core class meetings, as well as for those who want to dedicate a ton of time to it.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"cohort-size\"\n    }}>{`Cohort Size`}</h3>\n    <p>{`How might your course feel different with (say) 8 participants vs. 25? What's the ideal size range for a cohort, and how might you use e.g. breakout groups or 1:1 pairings to establish the sorts of dynamics that might be most beneficial for your course?`}</p>\n    <p>{`An important general point here is that some things scale pretty nicely, and some things don't scale well past a certain point at all. With every size comes tradeoffs. We've found that it's natural to prefer a more intimate group where you can get to know everyone on a more personal level, but larger cohorts often have more energy and overall activity, and stronger self-organizing dynamics.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You might consider mixing modes of group interactions to support a larger cohort size while still cultivating community and ways for people to get to know each other.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"cost\"\n    }}>{`Cost`}</h3>\n    <p>{`This cost of your course, along with your cohort size and the time it requires, combine to affect both who will enroll and how sustainable it will be for you as the facilitator.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's important not to undercharge, both to make sure it's worth your while and to make sure participants take it seriously. At the same time, very high prices can make courses less accessible. Consider what makes sense for your course topic and likely audience — and also consider ways to make your pricing flexible, for example offering a scholarship rate for a certain number of participants.\nFor more on this topic, see our guide `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://app.krakenedu.com/library/how-to-think-about-course-pricing\"\n      }}>{`How to Think About Course Pricing`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"discussion-and-feedback\"\n    }}>{`Discussion and Feedback`}</h3>\n    <p>{`How much of the course is based on group discussions? If it involves personal feedback, how is that structured? Group critiques or 1:1 feedback?`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Meta Course, for example, is based largely around discussing broad themes (such as these!) as a group, and providing individualized feedback on specific courses (in breakout groups, and on the forum). Do people describe the feedback they wish to receive, or is there a structured process the group will use consistently?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Good feedback is challenging — both to give and to receive! It can be difficult to hear feedback, but it's also difficult to offer critique that is constructive and useful. It requires trust in both directions.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"creation-of-trust\"\n    }}>{`Creation of Trust`}</h3>\n    <p>{`How do we create space for trust to develop between people, especially given that in most cases, participants will join a course as strangers?`}</p>\n    <p>{`One important consideration is that courses often require both time and intentional effort to set the groundwork for establishing trust. You should be clear about things like expectations for group interactions, and how people can give and receive feedback generously. And be aware that it might take a couple weeks for folks to get to know one another — participants will have a higher baseline of trust in week five than in week two.\nYou may also want to think about creating space for different types of interactions, a kind of intimacy gradient — ways for people to share work to the full cohort, and ways to talk with peers 1:1 or in small groups, which some may find more comfortable.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"synchronous-vs-asynchronous-activity\"\n    }}>{`Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Activity`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Consider how you'll balance in-class activity (synchronous e.g. group calls) and ways to participate outside of class, on participants' own schedules (asynchronous e.g.  forum discussion).`}</p>\n    <p>{`Synchronous time is great for demanding accountability, as well as for building community and friendships. Within the live parts of a class, it's great to mix up the structure, both to avoid boredom and to give folks multiple ways to engage. You might structure each live meeting to have a brief lecture, a short activity, discussion in breakout groups, and a summary with the full group.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Asynchronous activity is great for giving participants more flexibility. A common format for this it to have people post their response to a prompt or assignment, and have others give written feedback when they're able.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An interesting synchronous mode to explore is \"parallel play\", where participants are doing something together, not necessarily interacting in a group, but working in the presence of others, for a feeling of community and accountability. Optional live sessions, including learner-scheduled ones, can work nicely for this.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"course-meta-narrative\"\n    }}>{`Course Meta-Narrative`}</h3>\n    <p>{`It can be useful to encourage participants to engage with both the content of the course, and the shape and experience of the course itself — for example, you might do a project together, but also discuss how you came up with that project, and (afterwards) how it might be improved. After Stewart Brand, we might ask ourselves: How do courses learn?`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is useful on two levels. On the level of the course, from your perspective as a facilitator, this can help you evaluate the design and improve it for next time. And on the level of each participant's experience, it can help them think about their learning goals and how best to work within the parameters of the course to achieve them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This can empower people to feel greater agency in the learning process, and allow for multiple definitions of success and growth, both in the course and beyond it.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"building-your-course-structure\"\n    }}>{`Building Your Course Structure`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Here are a few practical steps and exercises we've found helpful in beginning to think through the above.

This includes both your personal goals for the course, and the things you want participants to learn, make, or achieve.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can brainstorm a list of success criteria. Some things to think about:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What should a learner be able to do (or know) that they couldn't before?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`How does the course relate to your personal, career, or creative goals?`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Examples of what success criteria might look like for learners:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Learners should be able to think critically about new UI aesthetics, and have fun in the process`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Learners should be able to apply the basics of typography to a live website using HTML/CSS/JS`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Learners should have created a personal website that expresses themselves and gives them a home on the internet`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"concept-mapping\"\n    }}>{`Concept Mapping`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Once you have a course topic in mind, and some goals for what you want to achieve, you can try creating a concept map for the course, either on paper or an online tool like Miro. Think about the possibility space of the course topic, using the lens of your goals and success criteria to scope down the full range of concepts to ones that will be most impactful for this course.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Some things to help guide this:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What are the essential topics, themes, concepts, questions, assignments (etc.) for the goals you've set out?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What structures might work well for bringing these pieces together to meet those goals?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What potential trade-offs might there be in this process?`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"creating-an-outline\"\n    }}>{`Creating an Outline`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Once you've started to get a sense of what you'd like to cover in the course, you can spend some time thinking through the right sequencing and details of the structure that might work best. You'll combine the course material with the structural elements above to create an outline of what the course looks like.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is an iterative process. To start, it will probably be a week by week outline with main themes and things you want to cover in each week. As you flesh it out you'll add details like specific readings, assignments, or exercises. And eventually you'll likely want to outline the structure of each individual class session, with approximate timing for lectures, discussions, exercises, breakouts, and other activities.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"assembling-the-pieces\"\n    }}>{`Assembling the Pieces`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Finally, time to put all the pieces together!`}</p>\n    <p>{`With your final course structure, you'll do your best to balance competing factors like ambitious goals and reasonable length; prerequisites and audience; cohort size and cost.
