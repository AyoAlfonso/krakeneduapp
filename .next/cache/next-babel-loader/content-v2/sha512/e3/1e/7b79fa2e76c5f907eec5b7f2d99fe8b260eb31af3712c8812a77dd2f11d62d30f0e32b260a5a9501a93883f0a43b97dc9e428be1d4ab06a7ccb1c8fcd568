Ideally you want to balance the workload such that it comes across as meaningful, but doesn't scare people off.

With every size comes tradeoffs. We've found that it's natural to prefer a more intimate group where you can get to know everyone on a more personal level, but larger cohorts often have more energy and overall activity, and stronger self-organizing dynamics.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You might consider mixing modes of group interactions to support a larger cohort size while still cultivating community and ways for people to get to know each other.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"cost\"\n    }}>{`Cost`}</h3>\n    <p>{`This cost of your course, along with your cohort size and the time it requires, combine to affect both who will enroll and how sustainable it will be for you as the facilitator.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's important not to undercharge, both to make sure it's worth your while and to make sure participants take it seriously. At the same time, very high prices can make courses less accessible.

You should be clear about things like expectations for group interactions, and how people can give and receive feedback generously. And be aware that it might take a couple weeks for folks to get to know one another — participants will have a higher baseline of trust in week five than in week two.\nYou may also want to think about creating space for different types of interactions, a kind of intimacy gradient — ways for people to share work to the full cohort, and ways to talk with peers 1:1 or in small groups, which some may find more comfortable.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"synchronous-vs-asynchronous-activity\"\n    }}>{`Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Activity`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Consider how you'll balance in-class activity (synchronous e.g. group calls) and ways to participate outside of class, on participants' own schedules (asynchronous e.g.  forum discussion).`}</p>\n    <p>{`Synchronous time is great for demanding accountability, as well as for building community and friendships. Within the live parts of a class, it's great to mix up the structure, both to avoid boredom and to give folks multiple ways to engage. You might structure each live meeting to have a brief lecture, a short activity, discussion in breakout groups, and a summary with the full group.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Asynchronous activity is great for giving participants more flexibility. A common format for this it to have people post their response to a prompt or assignment, and have others give written feedback when they're able.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An interesting synchronous mode to explore is \"parallel play\", where participants are doing something together, not necessarily interacting in a group, but working in the presence of others, for a feeling of community and accountability.

After Stewart Brand, we might ask ourselves: How do courses learn?`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is useful on two levels. On the level of the course, from your perspective as a facilitator, this can help you evaluate the design and improve it for next time. And on the level of each participant's experience, it can help them think about their learning goals and how best to work within the parameters of the course to achieve them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This can empower people to feel greater agency in the learning process, and allow for multiple definitions of success and growth, both in the course and beyond it.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"building-your-course-structure\"\n    }}>{`Building Your Course Structure`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Here are a few practical steps and exercises we've found helpful in beginning to think through the above.
