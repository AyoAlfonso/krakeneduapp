A related one: concreteness (will this course leave you with a specific tangible output?)`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you can identify some of these and show how they apply to your course, you may find this helps in more clearly demonstrating its value to prospective students.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"examples\"\n    }}>{`Examples`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There's quite a range of shapes, sizes, formats, topics, and pricing structures — for courses, workshops, salons, and seminars — on- and offline.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Broadly speaking there are two main categories of courses, those based primarily on content (e.g. watching a sequence of videos) and those based on a live group experience (working and learning together in a cohort). KrakenEdu courses are, of course, the latter, and these types of courses tend to cost more than purely content-based courses, though there's substantial variation in both.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"content-based-courses\"\n    }}>{`Content-Based Courses`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`$10s: on the low end, things like ebooks / discount courses where you watch a few videos`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Low to mid $100s: comprehensive video courses, sometimes with a community component`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Mid $100s to low $1,000s: courses with a significant amount of content in multiple formats, and often a community component or even personal feedback`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"live-cohort-based-courses\"\n    }}>{`Live Cohort-Based Courses`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Low $100s: courses on the shorter side, often more introductory, less intensive / individualized`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Mid $100s: medium-length courses, with relatively small cohorts (common range on Krakenedu)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`High $100s to low $1,000s: longer, more intensive`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Mid $1,000s on up: intensive premium courses, often very specialized e.g. advanced professional training`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"krakenedu-courses\"\n    }}>{`KrakenEdu Courses`}</h3>\n    <p>{`To give you some concrete numbers: so far most KrakenEdu courses tend to be priced in the $100–$300 range. These are typically courses ~4–6 weeks long, with an upper limit of ~10–15 learners.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For courses that are particularly specialized, teach specific valuable skills, or are a bit longer we expect the upper limit may be considerably higher, say $500–$1,000 or more.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One thing to note is that several courses have started on the lower end for their first cohort, as a way to beta test and ensure a full initial cohort, and successfully increased prices for subsequent cohorts. For example you might try an initial price of $150, and if it sells out, try bumping it to $300 for the second cohort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We also suggest picking a price at the higher end of what you're comfortable with, so that you have room to offer scholarship rates (e.g. 50% discount for students or others who need assistance) and still make it viable overall.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
