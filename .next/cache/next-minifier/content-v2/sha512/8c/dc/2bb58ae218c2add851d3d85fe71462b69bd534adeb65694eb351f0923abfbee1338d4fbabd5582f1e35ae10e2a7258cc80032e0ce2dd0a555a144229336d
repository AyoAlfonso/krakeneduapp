Even beyond that, we want to support modular learning, where learners can assemble their own long-term curriculum based on their individual goals, desired skills, and the communities they're a part of.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Great learning is inherently context specific, and those contexts are always shifting: learning aligned with hobbies, career skills, personal projects, and more.

Instead we're concerned with enabling peer-to-peer learning, community interaction both within courses, and between them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To this end, we want to build flexible tools specifically suited to these types of community-driven courses — a space we expect will be vastly more varied than your typical semester-length college course or skill-focused video sequence.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"an-rd-lab-for-internet-pedagogy\"\n    }}>{`An R&D Lab for Internet Pedagogy`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We're also making it a large part of our mission to ourselves do research and experimentation, and provide facilitators with support.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's common for large research universities to have a \"center for teaching and learning\"; this doesn't really exist in a meaningful sense for independent internet learning, but it needs to!`}</p>\n    <p>{`We consider KrakenEdu to be not only an internet platform, but an internet school, and a community of practice for ambitious and experimental educators in this new paradigm.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our approach is highly experimental, aimed at rapid feedback and iteration to develop modular learning infrastructure that can be used by entire networks of courses.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We envision developing a portfolio of tools for various independent courses and schools to use, in different combinations and at different scales.
