This felt like about the right group size, though we may need to either expand the total call time or make the Meta Course more focused (more on that below!)`}</p>\n    <p>{`We had a good variety of courses, many either creative or tech-adjacent.

Some also mentioned that it's nice simply knowing that the KrakenEdu community exists for people interested in talking about this stuff, as a space to return to for other workshop or course ideas in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"challenges\"\n    }}>{`Challenges`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There are plenty of points of friction and confusion that can make the course creation process difficult.

We could build a stronger ideation process into the Meta Course, to help creators think critically early on about what would be interesting to them, and what they are looking to get out of facilitating the course.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"video-troubles\"\n    }}>{`Video Troubles`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Video calls for KrakenEdu courses could be a lot better! We tried setting up our own Jitsi server — appealing because it's open source and very flexible — but the quality left a lot to be desired, and we'd like to explore better video integrations. It was also a bit odd to have the video calls in a forum embed; a separate Zoom window felt easier to use.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"need-for-structure\"\n    }}>{`Need for Structure`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The casual structure was nice, but we might benefit from making certain things more explicit, particularly the intended output of the Meta Course, and expectations for work in between the live sessions.

Test Runs, sessions to practice facilitating an aspect of a course, were helpful, but we could build in more structure here, and provide more options e.g. for making use of breakout groups.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"initial-changes\"\n    }}>{`Initial Changes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We've made some initial changes to the Meta Course already, between the first and third cohorts:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Synchronous activity:`}</strong>{` Built more structured activity time into the group calls, e.g. in Call #1 added time to draft and post an initial idea, and allocated more time for feedback in the later calls.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Test Runs:`}</strong>{` Added as a space for facilitation practice. These were optional, and not everyone tried them, but those who did found them helpful.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Logistical clarity:`}</strong>{` we tried to clarify both how KrakenEdu works and what the structure of the Meta Course involves, e.g. by including an earlier announcement about the Test Run option.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Live retrospective:`}</strong>{` we did the last retro via group conversation, which felt more dynamic than written feedback only.

It might be useful to split the Meta Course into two parts, one for initial ideation and syllabus generation, and the other for actually testing out an idea and getting hands-on facilitation practice.

Can we facilitate testing out courses with extreme time scales, or other radical structures?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`What might encourage more asynchronous discussion on the forum (or elsewhere)? Perhaps we can build in some more explicit functionality for prompts or automated reminders.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`How can build a better-feeling cohort space for live group learning? How can we design for a communal feel to the calls and conversations?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Can we get participants' networks involved earlier?
